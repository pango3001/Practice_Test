8.2   True/False Questions

1) True/False:  The bubble sort is an easy way to arrange data into ascending order, but it cannot arrange data into descending order.
Answer:  FALSE

2) True/False:  The number of comparisons made by a binary search is expressed in powers of two.
Answer:  TRUE

3) True/False:  In the average case, an item is just as likely to be found near the beginning of an array as near the end.
Answer:  TRUE

4) True/False:  A linear search can only be implemented with integer values.
Answer:  FALSE

5) True/False:  Before you can perform a selection sort, the data must be stored in ascending order.
Answer:  FALSE

6) True/False:  Before you can perform a bubble sort, the data must be stored in descending order.
Answer:  FALSE

7) True/False:  Using a binary search, you are more likely to find an item than if you use a linear search.
